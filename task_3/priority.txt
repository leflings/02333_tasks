Add a priority field to the thread data structure

When calling createprocess i will let it have say 64 priority levels
So i will let the lowest 6 bits represent the priority, and everything above that represent executable number

so createprocess system call will have to do some masking/unmasking but other than that i can use the new data structure to handle it
